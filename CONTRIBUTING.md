First of all, thank you for contributing. Itâ€™s appreciated!

1. Fork the repo.
2. Select or define a category that fits your app. If you're in doubt take a look at the App Store.
3. Follow the convention of using a link pointing to the github repo with a meaningful title stripped for the words 'react native'.
4. Consider adding an image or even better a gif showcasing your app. The image should be added to the `/screens` directory. Give the screenshot the same name as your github repo with the appropriate image extension.
5. Indicate in README.md your apps target platform by adding: `[][phone]` or `[][tablet]`.
As an added bonus you can use this as a link to the screenshot. Add a reference point in the bottom of README.md, e.g.: 
`[RssReaderPhone]: screens/react-native-rss-reader.gif?raw=true` and use this reference in combination with the target platform icon: `[![][phone]][RssReaderPhone]`. For people having an image preview extension added to their browser they can simply view screenshots by hovering over this image link.
